# In-House Model Context Protocol Subsystem (`mcp/`)

This directory houses the sovereign in-house Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers (`mcp/servers/*`) and shared protocol libraries (`mcp/core/*`) authored for the `Vitoria-Rodrigues` organization.

---

## 1. Overview

The `mcp/` subsystem enforces **Subsystem-Internal Partitioning** and **Self-Contained Sovereign Packaging**:
- **Deployable MCP Servers (`mcp/servers/*`)**: Independent, versioned TypeScript packages bundled via `tsup` (`noExternal`) into standalone CommonJS executables implementing a **Dual-Transport Architecture**:
  1. **Streamable HTTP Transport (`src/index.ts` -> `dist/index.cjs`)**: Fastify HTTP server listening on `:8080` (or `PORT` environment variable) serving `/mcp` endpoints for Kubernetes cluster deployments.
  2. **Stdio Transport (`src/bin.ts` -> `dist/bin.cjs`)**: Self-contained CLI runner inlining `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` and runtime dependencies, connecting via standard input/output with diagnostic logging routed to `stderr`.
  3. **Sovereign Launcher (`scripts/launcher.cjs` & `mcp.json`)**: Co-located launcher script exposed as the package `bin` (`mcp-<name>`) that loads `.env` in cascade, supports cluster gateway failover (`MESH_PROFILE=cluster`), and spawns `dist/bin.cjs` with zero external dependencies.
- **Shared Core Libraries (`mcp/core/*`)**: Non-executable TypeScript libraries shared across multiple domain-scoped MCP servers via `workspace:*` and bundled directly into downstream server executables at build time.

## 2. Deployable Server Matrix (`mcp/servers/*`)

| Server Directory | NPM Package Name | Sovereign Launcher & Bundles | Default HTTP Port | Status & Role | Primary Capabilities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [servers/firecrawl/](./servers/firecrawl/README.md) | `@vitoria-rodrigues/mcp-firecrawl` | `scripts/launcher.cjs`<br>`dist/bin.cjs` / `dist/index.cjs` | `:8080` | Production Active | Deep web scraping, crawling, site mapping, and markdown extraction. |
| [servers/github-flow/](./servers/github-flow/README.md) | `@vitoria-rodrigues/mcp-github-flow` | `scripts/launcher.cjs`<br>`dist/bin.cjs` / `dist/index.cjs` | `:8080` | Production Active | Tier 3 developer Git workflows, branches, pull requests, and Actions diagnostics. |
| [servers/memory/](./servers/memory/README.md) | `@vitoria-rodrigues/mcp-memory` | `scripts/launcher.cjs`<br>`dist/bin.cjs` / `dist/index.cjs` | `:8080` | Production Active | Semantic RAG vector store, episodic memory, and chat history. |
| [servers/playwright/](./servers/playwright/README.md) | `@vitoria-rodrigues/mcp-playwright` | `scripts/launcher.cjs`<br>`dist/bin.cjs` / `dist/index.cjs` | `:8080` | Production Active (Sovereign + Fallback) | Executes local `dist/bin.cjs` when `playwright` is installed; falls back to `@playwright/mcp@0.0.84` when unbundled in external consumers. |
| [servers/linkedin/](./servers/linkedin/README.md) | `@vitoria-rodrigues/mcp-linkedin` | `scripts/launcher.cjs`<br>`dist/bin.cjs` / `dist/index.cjs` | `:8080` | Production Active | LinkedIn profile optimization, job matching, Easy Apply automation, and candidate resume catalog management. |

## 3. Shared Core Libraries Matrix (`mcp/core/*`)

| Core Directory | NPM Package Name | Entrypoint | Consumed & Bundled By | Primary Capabilities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [core/github/](./core/github/README.md) | `@vitoria-rodrigues/mcp-core-github` | `dist/index.js` | `mcp-github-flow` | Three-Tier GitHub App authentication, Octokit client factory, and shared Zod schemas. |

## 4. Build & Development Pipeline

Pipelines are orchestrated through Turborepo using pnpm catalogs and `tsup`. Because `mcp/servers/*/dist/` is tracked in Git (`!mcp/servers/*/dist/`) for zero-token Git package consumption, always commit rebuilt bundles after source changes:

```bash
# Build all MCP packages (core tsc + servers tsup bundles) topologically
pnpm mcp:build

# Typecheck all MCP packages
pnpm mcp:typecheck

# Clean all build outputs
pnpm mcp:clean
```

### Individual Target Builds

```bash
pnpm mcp:core-github:build
pnpm mcp:firecrawl:build
pnpm mcp:github-flow:build
pnpm mcp:memory:build
pnpm mcp:playwright:build
```
